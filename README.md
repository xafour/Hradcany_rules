# Hradčany Rules - Project Documentation

**Verze:** 0.9  
**Datum:** 2026-01-06  
**Status:** ✅ DRAFT (ACTIVE)

Documentation, architecture decisions, and workflow specifications for the Hradčany stamp recognition project.

**Note:** This repository contains design documentation only. Source code is in a private repository.

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as a **knowledge base** for the Hradčany project, ensuring continuity across development sessions and preventing context loss.

## 📚 Structure

- **`CONSTITUTION.md`** - Fundamental project rules (immutability, append-only, recovery)
- **`INDEX.md`** - Documentation map (what to read when)
- **`base/`** - Immutable base documentation (versioned: v1, v2, v3...)
- **`decisions/`** - Design decisions log (append-only, dated)

## 🏛️ Core Principles

1. **Immutability** - Base docs never edited, only new versions created
2. **Append-only decisions** - History preserved, never deleted
3. **Mandatory reading** - Each session starts with documentation review
4. **Verification** - Changes reviewed before commit
5. **Recovery** - Clear procedures when context is lost

## 📖 For AI Assistants

If you're an AI assistant working on this project:
1. Read `CONSTITUTION.md` first (fundamental rules)
2. Read `INDEX.md` to understand what to read today
3. Load relevant base docs and recent decisions
4. Follow the rules strictly
